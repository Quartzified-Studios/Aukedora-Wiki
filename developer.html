                    <p style= "font-size: 22px">Quartzi is the creator and developer of Aukedora. Thats basically it... or do you want some back story... FINE</p>
                    <p style= "font-size: 18px">Quartzi started programming at around the age of 8... what a fkn nerd. He started with Java back in 2008. In 2010-2011 he then moved on into a completly different territory and entered the era of The Unity Game Engine, but back then everything was written in JavaScript, BUT in 2015 he made a complete shift to C#. So in theory Quartzi has 12 years of programming experience and about 9 years of Unity experience... but who defuq would actually believe that am I right. He doesn't even know how to make Hello World work in regular C# this darn potatoe.</p>
                    <p>"This aint helping me in getting an actually job... I can already tell that" - Quartzi 1 minute into writing this.</p>
