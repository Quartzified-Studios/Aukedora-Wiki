                    <h1>How did Aukedora Start?</h1>
                    <h3>A Short Story of how it came to be.</h3>
                    <p style= "font-size: 22px">Aukedora was once a story which Quartzi wrote in 8th grade. It was about a young boy finding a slime like creature which was thought to be a god in many legends. This Slime would create an emotional bond with this young boy and what made this slime so powerful is that it would change its physical state and powers dependent on the emotions of who it is attached too. This boy was very young and the only reason why he ended up finding this slime is because his home was underattack by a group of bandits and his father threw him into a well inside the mine they lived across from and then proceded to protect his ground. This boy is still very young and has not learned to controll his emotions, but he will notice later on in the story that all of his emotions translate to the actions of his new best pal.</p>
                    <p>The full 3-4 Chapters of the story have since been lost and the only person who still cries over it is Quartzi. "I still get dreams of some of the adventures that he is going through, and while the story is lost, it isn't as it will always be apart of me and my past." - Quartzi</p>

                    <h1>What is Aukedora now?</h1>
                    <h3>THE MMO OF A LIFE TIME! JK LOL U THOUGHT XD</h3>
                    <p style= "font-size: 22px">Aukedora is developing itself into a MMORPG with a slight twist. The world is Open and the idea is that when new content is added we will tell you it is there, but we wont tell you where. For anyone who is familiar with The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, I have taken much inspiration from there and decided to make Aukedora not just a Open World MMORPG but a Adventure game aswell. But thats not all of it. My Love for PvP in games such like World of Warcraft are clinicly insane. Aukedora's PvP System is based on Territory. Every Island, City, Town can be captured for one of the factions (Even the main city O.o mega rewards).</p>
                    <p>"Aukedora is my adaptations of all the different MMOs I have played and just making it into something I really seek for in these Games." - Quartzi</p>

                    <h1>Where is Aukedora now?</h1>
                    <h3>Its coming along.</h3>
                    <p style= "font-size: 22px">Aukedora is currently in its earliest development... hold on thats a complete lie. Aukedora in theory is already in a "playable" state, but it is missing many of its main systems. The most important one in my eyes being the Territory capture system. Also just for the record... I have no 2D or 3D art skills so the released Alpha will most likely look very blocky. I as a programmer would rather have working code, and that tested before even adressing most graphical options.</p>
                    <p>If you are wondering how far away we currently are for the first Chronicle of Aukedora, visit the Alpha Roadmap Tab.</p>

                    <p style= "font-size: 22px">Ya gotta have fun doing things like these. And I love expressing myself, and I also really hate writing things formally unless its me writing to a person I like *cough cough* I bet she be reading this right now! HIDE O.o I had to much sugar</p>
                    <p>I will most likely update this into a more formal and profesional manner, so enjoy the "oldschool" webpage for now :P</p>
